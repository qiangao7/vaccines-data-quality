# Design elements ----

# key study dates
# The dates are saved in json format so they can be read in by R and python scripts
# - firstpossiblevax_date is the date from which we want to identify covid vaccines. the mass vax programme was 8 Dec 2020 but other people were vaccinated earlier in trials, so want to pick these people up too (and possibly exclude them)
# - start_date is when we start the observational period proper, at the start of the mass vax programme
# - end_date is when we stop the observation period. This may be extended as the study progresses

# statistical disclosure control rounding precision
sdc_threshold <- 10

# create flu study dates json

# make these available in the global environment
# so we don't have to use `study_dates$start_date` or `start_date <- study_dates$start_date` in each script
